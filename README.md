# Omada Installer
A script to perform a new install of the TP-Link Omada Software Controller on Ubuntu.

This script was created due to convoluted or outdated guides on the web for installing the Omada Controller. The goal was to create a clean, simple script that anyone can run for ease of deployment.

Special thanks to @willquill for his Omada Ubuntu 16.04 guide :)

# Supported releases
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

# Recommended specs

# Install
Connect via SSH or console, run the following command and enjoy a sip of coffee ;)

```
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llegomark/omada-installer/main/install-omada-controller.sh | sudo bash

Once finished, complete the inital setup wizard in your web browser via the URL in the final output.

### Usage

The script is located as a symlink in `/usr/bin`
